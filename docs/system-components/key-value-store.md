# Key-Value Store

### What is a Key-Value Store?

-   A key-value store is a type of database that stores data as key-value pairs.

### Common Key-Value Store Operations:

-   GET(key): Retrieve the value associated with a key
-   PUT(key, value): Store a value associated with a key
-   DELETE(key): Remove the key-value pair associated with a key

### Key-Value Store Implementations:

-   In-Memory Key-Value Store: Data is stored in memory, which makes it fast but volatile
-   Disk-Based Key-Value Store: Data is stored on disk, which makes it slower but persistent
-   Distributed Key-Value Store: Data is stored across multiple machines for scalability and fault tolerance

### Examples of Key-Value Stores:

-   **Redis**: An in-memory, disk-persistent key-value store that supports complex data structures and distributed data storage
-   **Memcached**: An in-memory key-value store that is often used for caching web data
-   **Riak**: A distributed key-value store that is designed for fault tolerance and scalability
-   **Cassandra**: A distributed key-value store that is optimized for write-heavy workloads and can handle large amounts of data.

### Considerations When Using Key-Value Stores:

-   Choosing the right implementation based on your needs and [Requirements](/glossary/requirements.md).
-   Data modeling, as key-value stores have limited querying capabilities.
-   Scalability, as distributed key-value stores can be more complex to manage and operate than single-node key-value stores.
-   Data [Consistency](/glossary/consistency.md), as key-value stores often sacrifice Consistency for [Performance](/glossary/performance.md) and [Scalability](/glossary/scalability.md).
