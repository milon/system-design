# Use Case

A use case is a functional description that illustrates how a system will be used to accomplish a specific goal from the perspective of an end-user. It defines the sequence of interactions between the system and the user necessary to achieve the desired outcome. 

Use cases serve multiple purposes:

- **Requirements Definition**: They help stakeholders understand the system's functionality by demonstrating how it should behave in various scenarios. They capture the requirements from an end-user's point of view.
- **System Testing**: Use cases are instrumental in creating test cases. Each step in a use case can be translated into a test scenario, ensuring that all user interactions are tested and that the system meets the requirements.
- **User Documentation**: They can also be used as the basis for user manuals and help guides, as they describe the system's functionality in a way that non-technical stakeholders can understand.

Each use case includes:

- **Actor**: The user or other systems that interact with the system.
- **System**: The specific system or function being described.
- **Goal**: The ultimate result that the actor aims to achieve.
- **Preconditions**: The conditions that must be true before the use case can be started.
- **Basic Flow or Main Success Scenario**: A step-by-step description of the interactions between the actor and the system that lead to the goal being accomplished.
- **Alternative Flows**: Variations on the basic flow to cover different possibilities.
- **Postconditions**: The conditions that must be true after the use case has been completed.
- **Exception Flows**: What the system should do if the main flow or alternative flows fail.

Use cases are valuable in the early stages of development for understanding user needs and later in the cycle for validation and verification of the system's functionality. They are a key component of many software development methodologies, particularly those that follow a user-centered design approach.
