# Data Integrity

Within a technical framework, data integrity pertains to the reliability and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle, which includes its storage, processing, and transfer.

To maintain data integrity, a range of techniques are utilized, such as error-checking codes, checksums, and cryptographic hash functions. These techniques help to identify and rectify any errors or interference, assuring that data remains consistent and genuine.

Furthermore, the safeguarding of data integrity is bolstered by implementing access controls and permissions to restrict the alterations or deletion of data, as well as through audit trails and logging systems, which document all interactions with the data for subsequent examination.

The preservation of data integrity is crucial for applications where precise and dependable data is paramount, like in financial services, healthcare, and scientific inquiry. In such fields, any compromise of data integrity can lead to severe implications, including monetary loss, endangerment of patient safety, or the erosion of the validity of research findings.
