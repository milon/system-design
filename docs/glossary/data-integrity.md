# Data Integrity

In a technical context, data integrity refers to the assurance that data has not been corrupted, modified, or lost during its storage, processing, or transmission.

Data integrity is achieved through various methods, including error detection and correction codes, checksums, and cryptographic hashing algorithms. These methods are used to detect and correct errors or tampering attempts, and ensure that the data remains unchanged and authentic.

In addition, data integrity can be enforced through access controls and permissions, which limit who can access, modify, or delete data, and through auditing and logging mechanisms, which record all data access and modifications for later review.

Ensuring data integrity is essential for many applications, such as financial transactions, healthcare records, and scientific research, where accurate and reliable data is critical. In these contexts, any data corruption or tampering could have serious consequences, such as financial losses, compromised patient health, or invalidated research results.
