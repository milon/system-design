# HTTP

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It's a set of rules that enables web browsers and servers to exchange information. When you enter a web address in your browser, it sends an HTTP request to the server hosting that website. The server responds with an HTTP response, delivering the requested web page or data. HTTP defines how data should be structured, transmitted, and interpreted. It operates over the Internet and enables the seamless retrieval and display of web content, making it an essential protocol for web browsing and various web-based applications.

HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is an extension of the standard HTTP protocol used for secure data transmission over the Internet. It adds a layer of security by encrypting the data exchanged between a user's web browser and a web server. HTTPS uses cryptographic protocols such as SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to establish a secure connection, ensuring that data transmitted, including sensitive information like login credentials, payment details, and personal data, remains confidential and protected from interception by malicious actors. Websites using HTTPS are identified by a padlock icon and "https://" in the URL, indicating a secure and trustworthy connection.

### HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers that are returned by a web server in response to a client's request made to a web application or website. These status codes provide information about the outcome of the request and help both the client (usually a web browser) and the server understand how to proceed. HTTP status codes are an essential part of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.

HTTP status codes are divided into several classes, each with a specific meaning:

1. **1xx (Informational)**: These status codes indicate that the server has received the request and is continuing to process it. They are informational and typically not seen in practice.

2. **2xx (Successful)**: These status codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted by the server. Common codes include:
   - 200 OK: The request was successful, and the server is returning the requested data.
   - 201 Created: The request resulted in the creation of a new resource on the server.
   - 204 No Content: The request was successful, but there is no response body to return.

3. **3xx (Redirection)**: These status codes indicate that further action is needed by the client to complete the request. They are often used for redirects. Common codes include:
   - 301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a different URL.
   - 302 Found (or 303 See Other): The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL.

4. **4xx (Client Error)**: These status codes indicate that the client has made an error in the request. The client should take corrective action before resending the request. Common codes include:
   - 400 Bad Request: The server couldn't understand the request due to malformed syntax or other client-side issues.
   - 401 Unauthorized: The request requires authentication, and the client did not provide valid credentials.
   - 404 Not Found: The requested resource was not found on the server.

5. **5xx (Server Error)**: These status codes indicate that the server encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request. Common codes include:
   - 500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected error while processing the request.
   - 503 Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.

HTTP status codes are crucial for troubleshooting and debugging web applications, as they provide immediate feedback about the success or failure of a request. Web developers use these codes to understand and handle various scenarios when building and maintaining web services and websites, ensuring a smooth and informative user experience.
