# Encryption

Encryption is the method of converting data into a coded format to safeguard its privacy and accuracy. It serves as a critical security practice that deters unauthorized individuals from accessing sensitive information. This protective mechanism is applicable to data whether it is stored (at rest) or being sent (in transit).
