# Distributed System

A distributed system is a network that consists of autonomous computers that are connected using a distribution middleware. They help in sharing different resources and capabilities, to provide users with a single and integrated coherent network. The main goal of distributed systems is to make the entire network transparent to the user.

In a distributed system, each independent computer (or node) has its own memory and it processes its own tasks. The computers communicate with each other in order to achieve a common goal. These systems are distributed over different geographic locations.

They are designed based on the fact that there is no shared memory and the computers communicate over a network to share messages. The system has to manage the network so that the user perceives a single, unified system rather than a collection of separate computers.

Some key characteristics of distributed systems include:

1. **Concurrency**: Multiple components or processes can operate simultaneously.
2. **Scalability**: The system can easily be enlarged to accommodate more components and therefore, increase its performance.
3. **Fault tolerance**: The system can continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some of its components.
4. **Transparency**: The user should be unaware of where services and resources are located and how they are accessed.
5. **Reliability**: The system is reliable in the sense that it can be expected to perform the intended task accurately.
6. **Decentralization**: Each node or process in the system operates independently of the others.

Examples of distributed systems include the Internet, cellular networks, and the global positioning system (GPS). In the realm of computing, distributed systems can be used to run large, complex applications, providing fault tolerance and harnessing the power of multiple processors to address problems that can't be solved by a single computer.
