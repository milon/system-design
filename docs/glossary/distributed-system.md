# Distributed System

A distributed system is a network of computers that work together to perform a specific task or provide a particular service. 

In a distributed system, each computer node has its own processing power and memory, and is connected to other nodes through a communication network, such as the Internet. 

Distributed systems are designed to be 
- scalable, 
- fault-tolerant, 
- resilient, 

and can be used to handle large volumes of data, perform complex computations, or support high-traffic applications. 

Some examples of distributed systems include 

- Cloud computing platforms, 
- Peer-to-peer networks, 
- [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](/system-components/cdn.md). 
 
The design and implementation of distributed systems typically involve challenges related to synchronization, consistency, fault tolerance, and security.
