# Throughput

Throughput refers to the volume of data that a system is capable of processing or transmitting over a certain period, and it is often utilized as a metric to assess the performance of a system. It is a crucial factor for systems anticipated to manage substantial quantities of data.

In computing, throughput is usually measured in terms of data units per second, such as bits per second (bps), bytes per second (Bps), or data packets per second. The measurement can pertain to the capacity of networks, the speed at which a processor can execute tasks, or the rate at which data can be read from or written to a storage device.

For high-demand systems such as data servers, communication networks, and high-performance computing applications, achieving high throughput is essential for maintaining swift and efficient data handling, ensuring that the system can serve a large number of requests or transactions without undue delays or bottlenecks.
