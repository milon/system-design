# Requirements

Requirements are detailed specifications that outline the expected functions and behaviors of a system. They can be categorized into two main types:

1. **[Functional Requirements](/glossary/functional-requirement.md)**: These delineate the specific actions or services that the system must perform. For example, a functional requirement for a banking application might be the ability to process online payments.

2. **[Non-Functional Requirements](/glossary/non-functional-requirement.md)**: These specify the criteria that judge the operation of a system, usually related to system attributes such as reliability, performance, maintainability, scalability, and security. An example of a non-functional requirement might be that the banking application should ensure all online payment transactions are completed within two seconds under normal operation conditions.

Both functional and non-functional requirements play pivotal roles in the development process, guiding system designers and developers in building a system that aligns with user needs and expectations. Functional requirements focus on user or system tasks, while non-functional requirements focus on user expectations and system attributes.
