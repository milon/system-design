The ability of a system to continue operating even in the event of a hardware or software failure. Fault tolerance is an important consideration for ensuring system [[Availability]] and [[Reliability]].

## Key Concepts:

-   **Redundancy**: The use of redundant hardware or software components to ensure that critical functions can continue in the event of a failure.
-   **Failover**: The automatic or manual transfer of operations from a failed or failing component to a healthy one.
-   **Error Detection and Correction**: The use of error detection and correction techniques, such as checksums and error-correcting codes, to detect and correct errors in data or code.
-   **Graceful Degradation**: The ability of a system to continue operating at a reduced level of functionality or performance in the event of a failure or overload.

## Best Practices for Fault Tolerance:

-   Use redundant hardware or software components to prevent single points of failure.
-   Implement automated failover mechanisms to minimize downtime and ensure continuity of critical functions.
-   Use error detection and correction techniques to detect and correct errors in data or code.
-   Conduct regular testing and simulations to identify potential weaknesses and improve response times.
-   Use monitoring tools to detect and alert on system failures or anomalies.

## Examples of Fault Tolerant Architectures:

-   **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)**: A technology that uses multiple hard drives to store data redundantly and prevent data loss in the event of a drive failure.
-   **Clustered Computing**: The use of multiple computers to provide redundancy and failover capabilities for critical applications or services.
-   **Load Balancing**: The distribution of workloads across multiple servers to prevent overload or failure of any single server.
-   **Distributed Systems**: The use of a distributed architecture to provide redundancy and fault tolerance for critical functions.

## Metrics for Fault Tolerance:

-   **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: The average time between failures of a system.
-   **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)**: The average time it takes to repair a system after a failure.
-   **Availability**: The percentage of time a system is operational and accessible to users.

In conclusion, Fault Tolerance is a critical aspect of system design and performance. It involves designing systems that can continue to function and perform critical functions even in the presence of hardware or software faults or failures. Redundancy, failover mechanisms, error detection and correction techniques, and graceful degradation are some of the best practices that can help ensure fault tolerance of a system. RAID, clustered computing, load balancing, and distributed systems are some examples of fault-tolerant architectures. Metrics such as MTBF, MTTR, and availability can be used to measure and monitor the fault tolerance of a system.
