Consistency is a term used in computer science and database management to refer to the property of ensuring that data is accurate and valid over time and across different systems. 

In other words, consistency ensures that all copies of a piece of data are the same, even if multiple users are accessing and modifying it simultaneously. 

This is achieved through the use of protocols and algorithms that synchronize updates to the data, so that all users see a consistent view of the data at all times. 

Consistency is a key requirement in [[distributed system]]s, where data is stored on multiple nodes and accessed by multiple clients, as it helps to ensure that the system behaves predictably and reliably.
