ACID is a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions.

### ACID Properties:

-   **Atomicity**: Transactions are treated as a single unit of work that must be completed as a whole or rolled back as a whole in case of failure.
-   **Consistency**: Transactions bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining data integrity and enforcing rules and constraints.
-   **Isolation**: Transactions are executed as if they are the only transactions in the system, ensuring that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
-   **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and will survive system failures and crashes.

### Benefits of ACID:

-   **Data Integrity**: ACID properties ensure that data is stored reliably and consistently, without errors or inconsistencies.
-   **Reliability**: ACID properties guarantee that transactions are processed correctly, even in the face of system failures or crashes.
-   **Security**: ACID properties can prevent unauthorized access and ensure that sensitive data is protected from accidental or malicious changes.

### Limitations of ACID:

-   **Performance**: ACID properties can come at the cost of performance, as they require additional processing overhead and can slow down transaction processing.
-   **Scalability**: ACID properties can make it difficult to scale databases horizontally, as they require coordination and synchronization between nodes.
-   **Complexity**: ACID properties can make databases more complex and difficult to manage, particularly in distributed or cloud environments.

### ACID vs. BASE:

-   [[BASE]] (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) is an alternative approach to ACID that prioritizes availability and scalability over consistency.
-   BASE systems relax some or all of the ACID properties, allowing for more flexible and scalable database architectures, but at the cost of potential data inconsistency or loss in certain scenarios.

### Considerations When Using ACID:

-   Choosing the appropriate level of ACID compliance based on your needs and requirements
-   Proper data modeling and database design to ensure that transactions are processed efficiently and effectively
-   Balancing the benefits of ACID against the potential tradeoffs in performance, scalability, and complexity.
