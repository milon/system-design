Capacity planning is the process of determining the computing resources required to meet the current and future needs of a system or application. Capacity planning is an important aspect of system design and management, as it helps to ensure that the system is able to handle expected workloads without performance issues, downtime, or resource constraints.

Capacity planning involves several steps, including identifying the computing resources needed, estimating future demand, and allocating resources accordingly. This may involve analyzing historical data, modeling future scenarios, and conducting capacity testing to evaluate system performance under different conditions.

Capacity planning can be applied to various areas of computing, such as server infrastructure, network bandwidth, storage capacity, and application performance. It can also be used to optimize resource usage, identify potential bottlenecks, and plan for growth and scalability.

Effective capacity planning requires a good understanding of the system architecture, workload characteristics, and business goals. It also requires regular monitoring and analysis to ensure that the system is functioning as expected and that capacity is being used efficiently. Capacity planning can help organizations avoid performance issues, minimize downtime, and ensure that the system is able to meet the needs of the business both now and in the future.

### In the Interview Context 

Capacity planning is a common topic in system design and architecture interviews, particularly for roles in infrastructure, operations, and performance engineering. In such interviews, candidates may be asked to design and plan the capacity of a system or application, given certain requirements, constraints, and assumptions.
