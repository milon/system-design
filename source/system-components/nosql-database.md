A NoSQL database is a type of database that stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure first, allowing for more flexibility and faster development.

### Common NoSQL Database Characteristics:

-   Schemaless: NoSQL databases are schemaless, meaning that data can be stored without needing to define a schema first.
-   Non-Relational: NoSQL databases are non-relational, meaning that they do not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in relational databases.
-   Distributed: NoSQL databases are distributed, meaning that data is stored and processed across multiple nodes or servers.

### Common NoSQL Database Applications:

-   Web Applications: NoSQL databases are commonly used to store and manage data for web applications, such as user profiles, activity feeds, and product catalogs.
-   Mobile Applications: NoSQL databases are commonly used to store and manage data for mobile applications, such as user profiles, activity feeds, and product catalogs.
-   Internet of Things (IoT): NoSQL databases are commonly used to store and manage data for IoT applications, such as sensor data, log files, and device data.
-   Real-Time Analytics: NoSQL databases are commonly used to store and analyze large amounts of data in real time, such as user activity, financial transactions, and sensor data.

### Common NoSQL Database Technologies:

-  **[Document Databases](/system-components/document-storage)**: Document databases store data in documents, which are self-contained data structures that contain all of the information needed to understand the data.
-  **[Key-Value Stores](/system-components/key-value-store)**: Key-value stores store data as key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a single value.
-  **[Wide-Column Stores](/system-components/wide-column-database)**: Wide-column stores store data in columns instead of rows, allowing for efficient querying and storage of large, complex data sets.
-  **[Graph Databases](/system-components/graph-database)**: Graph databases store data in nodes and edges, allowing for efficient storage and querying of highly connected data.
-  **[Object Databases](/system-components/object-storage)**: Object databases store data in objects, which are instances of classes that contain both data and methods.
-  **Multi-Model Databases**: Multi-model databases combine multiple data models into a single database, allowing for more flexibility and efficiency.
-  **[In-Memory Databases](/system-components/in-memory-database)**: In-memory databases store data in memory instead of on disk, allowing for faster access and processing of data.
-  **[Search Engines](/system-components/search-engine-database)**: Search engines store data in indexes, allowing for efficient searching and retrieval of data.
-  **[Time-Series Databases](/system-components/time-series-database)**: Time-series databases store data with timestamps, allowing for efficient storage and analysis of time-series data.
-  **[NewSQL Databases](/system-components/newsql-database)**: NewSQL databases combine the scalability of NoSQL databases with the ACID guarantees of relational databases.
