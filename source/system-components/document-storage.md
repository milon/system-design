A document store is a type of NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, schema-less document format.

### Common Document Store Characteristics:

-   Flexible Schema: Document stores allow for flexible schema design, where documents can contain different fields and data types.
-   Hierarchical Data Model: Document stores often use a hierarchical data model, where documents can contain nested sub-documents and arrays.
-   Query Language: Document stores typically support a query language that allows for complex queries across multiple documents.
-   High Scalability: Document stores are designed to scale horizontally across multiple nodes and can handle large volumes of data and traffic.

### Common Document Store Applications:

-   Content Management Systems: Document stores are often used in content management systems, where content is stored as flexible, structured documents.
-   E-Commerce Platforms: Document stores are often used in e-commerce platforms, where product data and customer information can be stored as flexible, structured documents.
-   Internet of Things (IoT): Document stores are often used in IoT applications, where sensor data can be stored as flexible, structured documents.

### Common Document Store Databases:

-   **MongoDB**: An open-source, document-oriented database that is widely used and supports many features and extensions.
-   **Couchbase**: A distributed document-oriented database that combines the flexibility of document stores with the performance and scalability of NoSQL databases.
-   **Amazon DocumentDB**: A fully managed document-oriented database service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that is compatible with MongoDB.
-   **Azure Cosmos DB**: A fully managed, globally distributed database service offered by Microsoft Azure that supports multiple data models, including document stores.

### Considerations When Using a Document Store:

-   [Data Modeling](/glossary/data-modeling), as the flexible schema of document stores requires careful design to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.
-   Query Optimization, as complex queries can be slower and more difficult to optimize in document stores than in traditional relational databases.
-   [Data Integrity](/glossary/data-integrity), as the flexible schema of document stores can make it more difficult to ensure data consistency and enforce constraints and rules.
-   [Security](/glossary/security), as proper security measures need to be in place to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
