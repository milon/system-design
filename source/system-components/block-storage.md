Block storage is a type of data storage that stores data in fixed-sized blocks or chunks, allowing for efficient and fast access to stored data. Block storage is commonly used for storing data in databases, virtual machines, and high-performance computing applications.


### Common Block Storage Characteristics:

-   Fixed Block Size: Block storage uses a fixed block size, typically ranging from 512 bytes to several megabytes, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of data.
-   Random Access: Block storage allows for random access to stored data, allowing specific blocks to be read, written, or deleted as needed.
-   Low Latency: Block storage provides low latency access to stored data, making it ideal for use cases that require high-performance and fast access to data.
-   Data Persistence: Block storage typically provides persistence capabilities, allowing data to be stored even if the system is powered off or rebooted.

### Common Block Storage Applications:

-   Databases: Block storage is commonly used for storing database files, providing fast access to data and efficient read and write operations.
-   Virtualization: Block storage is used for storing virtual machine files, providing low-latency access to data and high-performance I/O operations.
-   High-Performance Computing: Block storage is used for storing data used in high-performance computing applications, such as scientific simulations, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

### Common Block Storage Technologies:

-   **Amazon Elastic Block Store** (EBS): A fully managed block storage service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides durable and low-latency access to data.
-   **Microsoft Azure Disk Storage**: A block storage service offered by Microsoft Azure that provides high-performance, scalable, and durable storage for virtual machines and applications.
-   **OpenStack Cinder**: An open-source block storage service that provides scalable and persistent block storage for OpenStack cloud environments.

### Considerations When Using Block Storage:

-   [[Capacity Planning]]: Block storage requires careful capacity planning to ensure that sufficient storage is available for current and future needs.
-   Data Protection: Appropriate data protection measures need to be in place to prevent data loss, such as data replication and backup.
-   [Performance](/glossary/performance): Block storage performance can be impacted by factors such as network latency, I/O load, and storage device type, and optimization techniques such as caching and load balancing may be necessary for achieving good performance.
-   Cost: Block storage costs can vary depending on factors such as storage capacity, I/O operations, and data transfer, and careful management of storage usage is necessary to keep costs under control.
