### Considerations When Using a Server:

-   [Security](/glossary/security), as servers can be a potential target for attacks and need to be secured appropriately to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
-   [Maintenance](/glossary/maintenance), as servers need to be regularly updated and maintained to ensure functionality and performance.
-   [Scalability](/glossary/scalability), as servers need to be able to handle increasing traffic and demand as the number of clients and services grows.
-   [Compatibility](/glossary/compatibility), as servers need to be compatible with the applications, databases, and other resources they are intended to manage or provide.
