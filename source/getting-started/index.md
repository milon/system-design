### How to use this website

This website is designed to help you prepare for system design interviews. It contains a collection of system design topics, each with a brief description, key characteristics, common applications, and example technologies. It also includes a glossary of common terms and a list of recommended resources for further reading.

First you need to go through the [Glossary](/glossary) section to get familiar with the terms used in system design. Then you can go through the [System Components](/system-components) section to learn about the different components of a system. Then, you can go through the [Architecture Patterns](/architecture-patterns) section to learn about the different architectural patterns in system design. Then you should go throung different example system design problems in the [Examples](/examples) section to understand better how to use those components in an interview setup.

Finally, you can go through the [Interview Techniques](/interview-techniques) section to learn about the  different techniques you can use in a system design interview.

I am planning to add more content in the future. So, please check back later for more content.
