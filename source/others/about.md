Over the past few years, I've participated in numerous interviews across a spectrum of companies, ranging from small startups to major tech giants. I've successfully navigated several system design interviews at various reputable firms, including multiple FAANG companies. Additionally, I've had the opportunity to interview couple of hundred candidates myself.

Through this extensive experience, I've observed a noticeable dearth of high-quality resources tailored to system design interview preparation. This observation motivated me to take the initiative and create this website, with the aim of assisting individuals in their preparations for system design interviews.

I've utilized Grammarly to help spot and correct such errors to the best of my ability. Nevertheless, Grammarly may not catch every mistake. Furthermore, I've employed ChatGPT to assist in rephrasing certain sentences, and any unintentional inaccuracies in the rephrasing are regrettable, and I extend my apologies for them.
