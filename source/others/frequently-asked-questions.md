### Tools used to build this site

This site was build with [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I used the default [docs](https://github.com/tighten/jigsaw-docs-template) template from Jigsaw and did very little to no modification. The logo was taken from [thenounproject](https://thenounproject.com/icon/database-design-3783547/).

For the diagrams, I used the excellent free and open souce software called [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) with System Design Component library from their official library store.
