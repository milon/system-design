After completing the preliminary steps of requirements engineering, data modeling, and API endpoint design, the next step in system design interviews is to draw the high-level architecture. It's important to focus on the core value proposition of the system and add supporting features to make it convenient to use.

For example, in the case of Netflix, it's essential to first draw the streaming portion of the system, including the video upload, before adding any search or recommendation features.

When designing the high-level architecture, it's crucial to reference the APIs defined earlier and comment on the estimated capacities required to support the system's functionality. This will help to ensure that the architecture is designed in a way that can handle the expected volume of requests, network traffic, and storage needs.

By taking a methodical and structured approach to system design interviews, engineers can demonstrate their ability to design scalable and user-friendly systems that meet the needs of users. By focusing on the core value proposition of the system and designing supporting features to make it convenient to use, designers can create systems that deliver outstanding user experiences and drive business success.
