# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed system of servers that delivers content to users based on their geographic location, reducing [latency](/glossary/latency.md) and improving [Performance](/glossary/performance.md).

### Common CDN Operations:

-   Caching: Storing frequently accessed content in edge servers to reduce latency and improve performance
-   Load Balancing: Distributing traffic across multiple servers to avoid overloading any single server
-   Content Optimization: Compressing, resizing, or transforming content to reduce file size and improve delivery speed
-   Security: Protecting against DDoS attacks, bots, and other security threats

### Advantages of Using a CDN:

-   Faster Content Delivery: Caching content in edge servers reduces latency and improves performance
-   Global Coverage: CDN servers are distributed globally, enabling content delivery to users in different locations
-   Scalability: CDN can handle sudden spikes in traffic and scale easily as traffic grows
-   Security: CDN can protect against DDoS attacks, bots, and other security threats

### Types of CDN Providers:

-   Traditional CDN Providers: Companies that offer a global network of servers for content delivery, such as Akamai, Cloudflare, and Fastly
-   Peer-to-Peer (P2P) CDN Providers: Companies that use a distributed network of user devices to deliver content, such as BitTorrent and LivePeer
-   Cloud CDN Providers: Cloud-based CDN services offered by major cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.

### Considerations When Using a CDN:

-   Choosing the right CDN provider based on your needs and requirements
-   Cost, as CDN services can be expensive depending on the amount of traffic and data usage
-   Performance, as the effectiveness of a CDN depends on the location of the end-users and the CDN servers
-   Integration, as CDN services need to be integrated with your website or application for effective content delivery.
