# Web Application

A web application is a software program that runs on a web server and is accessed through a web browser.

### Common Web Application Characteristics:

-   Client-Server Architecture: Web applications typically use a client-server architecture, where the client sends requests to the server and the server responds with data or content.
-   Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): Web applications use HTTP as the primary protocol for communication between the client and server.
-   User Interface: Web applications typically have a graphical user interface (GUI) that is rendered in a web browser or mobile device.
-   Statelessness: Web applications are typically stateless, meaning that each request is processed independently and the server does not retain information about previous requests.

### Common Web Application Technologies:

-   HTML/CSS/JavaScript: The core technologies used to build web applications, including markup for content (HTML), styling (CSS), and client-side scripting (JavaScript).
-   Server-Side Scripting: Technologies such as PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Node.js are used for server-side scripting and processing of web requests.
-   Database Management Systems: Web applications often use a database management system (DBMS) to store and manage data, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
-   Web Frameworks: Frameworks such as Django, Flask, and Ruby on Rails provide libraries and tools for building web applications more efficiently.

### Common Web Application Security Considerations:

-   Input Validation: Ensuring that user input is validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
-   Authentication and Authorization: Proper authentication and authorization measures need to be in place to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
-   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Measures need to be in place to prevent malicious scripts from being injected into web pages and stealing user data.
-   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Measures need to be in place to prevent unauthorized requests from being sent from a user's browser without their knowledge.
-   HTTPS: HTTPS should be used to encrypt web traffic and prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Considerations When Developing a Web Application:

-   User Experience, as the usability and design of a web application can significantly impact its success and adoption.
-   [Performance](/glossary/performance.md), as slow or unresponsive web applications can frustrate users and lead to lost traffic and revenue.
-   [Scalability](/glossary/scalability.md), as web applications need to be able to handle increasing traffic and data volumes as they grow.
-   [Maintenance](/glossary/maintenance.md) and [Security](/glossary/security.md), as web applications need to be regularly updated and secured to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure functionality.
