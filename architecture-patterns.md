# Architecture Patterns

Software architecture patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. These patterns provide a reusable blueprint that can be adapted to multiple scenarios.

These patterns can be used individually or in combination, depending on the problem domain and requirements. In practice, many systems use a hybrid approach, integrating multiple patterns to achieve the desired architectural goals. It's essential to understand the strengths, weaknesses, and applicability of each pattern before using them in a project.
