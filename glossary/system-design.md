# System Design

System design is the phase in the software development lifecycle where the system's blueprint is created, encompassing its architecture, the components and modules that constitute it, their interactions, as well as the data they manipulate. This is a pivotal stage, as it establishes the groundwork upon which the software will be constructed.

During this process, careful consideration is given to how the system will be structured and how the various parts will interact. The system's design is often illustrated using diagrams and documentation that describe:

- **High-Level Architecture**: This includes the overall system framework, defining how major parts of the system such as databases, servers, and user interfaces interact.
- **Component Design**: Focusing on the individual parts of the system, detailing their responsibilities and the services they provide.
- **Module Design**: Detailing finer-grained functionality and how it will be encapsulated in code.
- **Interface Design**: Specifying how the components and modules will communicate with each other, including APIs and data flows.
- **Data Design**: Defining how the data is organized, stored, and accessed, often involving data modeling.

System design needs to satisfy the specified functional and non-functional requirements, and it should be done keeping in mind qualities such as scalability, reliability, and maintainability. It sets a vital direction for developers, testers, and future maintainers of the system, hence influencing the development workflow, timelines, and potential success of the project.
