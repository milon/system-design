# Fuctional Requirement

Functional requirements define what a system is supposed to do, detailing the behaviors, functions, and features the system must support. These requirements are focused on the specific outcomes of what the system will be capable of doing, often articulated from the perspective of the user. 

In essence, functional requirements describe the various functions that the system should be able to perform, and these can include:

1. **Calculations that the system must perform** - What kind of data processing and analysis should the system do?
2. **Data processing and handling** - How should the system process, store, and retrieve data?
3. **User interface and interaction with the system** - How should the user interact with the system? What should the user be able to input and what output should they expect?
4. **Specific behavior under certain conditions** - How should the system behave in response to specific events or situations?
5. **Integration with other systems** - How should the system connect and communicate with other systems?
6. **Security features** - What are the security functions that protect the system and its data?

Functional requirements are a key part of any software requirements specification (SRS) and provide developers with the information they need to design and implement the system. They are usually captured in use cases, user stories, or as a detailed list of functional criteria the system must meet. It's important that functional requirements are clear, concise, and testable to ensure they can be understood by both stakeholders and the technical team, and to verify that the system meets the intended use after it has been built.
