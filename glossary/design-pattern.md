# Design Pattern

A design pattern in software engineering is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code; rather, it is a template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Design patterns are formalized best practices that a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. They can accelerate the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent such subtle issues from occurring, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.

There are many types of design patterns, but they are typically broken down into three categories:

1. **Creational patterns**: These deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or add complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation. Examples include the Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype.

2. **Structural patterns**: These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. Examples include the Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Composite, and Flyweight.

3. **Behavioral patterns**: These take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Examples include the Strategy, Observer, Command, Iterator, and State patterns.

Using design patterns encourages code reuse and can help to make a system more robust and maintainable. Moreover, they provide a shared language among developers, which can simplify communication during the development process.
