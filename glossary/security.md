# Security

Security in the context of computing systems refers to the safeguarding of a system and its data against illicit access, exploitation, revelation, disruption, alteration, or annihilation. It is a paramount concern for any system that handles or retains sensitive information.

Implementing robust security measures is critical to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of dataâ€”commonly referred to as the CIA triad in information security. This encompasses a range of strategies and mechanisms, such as:

- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users or entities within the system.
- **Authorization**: Ensuring that users have permission to access or modify data.
- **Encryption**: Encoding data to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Firewalls and network security**: Creating barriers to block unwanted access or attacks.
- **Intrusion detection systems**: Monitoring for suspicious activities that could indicate a security breach.
- **Data backup and recovery**: Creating copies of data to prevent loss in case of accidental deletion, corruption, or disasters.

Security practices and protocols are continuously evolving to counteract new and emerging threats. It is essential for organizations to periodically assess their security posture and implement layered security measures (known as "defense in depth") to create a robust and resilient environment for their systems and data.
