# Non-fuctional requirement

Non-functional requirements are criteria that specify the operational qualities of a system, such as how fast it must perform a given task (performance), how reliable it must be (reliability), how easy it is to use (usability), and how safe it must be (security). Unlike functional requirements that describe what a system should do, non-functional requirements focus on how the system should behave and limit the solutions that can meet the functional requirements.

These requirements can be categorized into various types, such as:

1. **Performance**: How quickly the system responds to a given input or how many transactions the system can handle in a given period.

2. **Scalability**: The system's ability to increase or decrease performance and cost in response to changes in application processing demands.

3. **Capacity**: The amount of data the system can handle effectively.

4. **Availability**: The degree to which the system is operational and accessible when required for use.

5. **Reliability**: The ability of the system to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period.

6. **Recoverability**: How well the system can recover from crashes, hardware failures, or other similar problems.

7. **Maintainability**: How easy it is to maintain the system, including diagnosing and fixing faults, upgrading the system, and meeting new requirements.

8. **Usability**: How easy and pleasant the system is to use.

9. **Security**: How well the system protects against unauthorized access and ensures data confidentiality and integrity.

10. **Compliance**: The system's ability to adhere to standards, regulations, and other legal requirements.

11. **Portability**: The ease with which the system can be transferred from one hardware or software environment to another.

Addressing non-functional requirements is essential for the overall quality and success of a software project. They are typically harder to measure than functional requirements, but they can greatly influence user satisfaction and system performance.
