# Model

A model is an abstracted depiction of a system or one of its sub-components, designed to facilitate comprehension, examination, or communication regarding the system. To construct these models, a range of methodologies can be employed, encompassing visual tools like diagrams and flowcharts, as well as quantitative methods such as mathematical equations. These models serve as simplified representations of the system, enabling stakeholders to grapple with complex concepts and interactions within the system without getting entangled in the minutiae of its full-scale operations.
