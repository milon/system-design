# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contract between a service provider and a customer that specifies the level of service expected. It defines performance metrics, responsibilities, and penalties related to services not meeting agreed-upon standards. SLAs ensure both parties have clear expectations and understand deliverables and timelines.
