# Consistency

Consistency in the realm of computer science and database management denotes the assurance that data remains correct and valid throughout its lifespan and across various platforms.

It means maintaining uniformity of data so that every instance of it remains identical, even when it is being accessed and altered by multiple users concurrently.

To maintain such consistency, specific protocols and algorithms are employed to coordinate data updates, ensuring that every user has a uniform perspective of the data at any given moment.

For distributed systems, where data is dispersed across numerous nodes and accessed by various clients, consistency is an indispensable element. It guarantees that the system's operations are dependable and predictable.
