# Latency

Latency refers to the time interval it takes for a data packet to traverse from one designated point to another across a network.

This time delay, typically quantified in milliseconds, encapsulates the duration a data packet takes to be transferred and can be influenced by numerous elements such as the physical distance between the communicating points, the velocity of the connection, the caliber of the network setup, and the time taken by devices to process the data.

Aiming for reduced latency is beneficial because it denotes swifter data transmission with fewer time lags. However, attaining minimal latency can pose challenges, particularly in intricate network configurations or scenarios where hefty data volumes must be conveyed across extensive distances.

Latency is a critical factor in many computing domains, like online gaming where real-time interaction is crucial, video streaming which requires smooth playback, and real-time communication services where immediate exchange is pivotal.
