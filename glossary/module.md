# Module

A module is a distinct segment of code that encapsulates a specific piece of functionality, allowing it to be utilized interchangeably across various systems. By housing particular features or behaviors, modules contribute to a system's abstraction, simplifying both the maintenance and the modification processes. This modularity is key to creating scalable and manageable codebases, where each module interacts with the rest of the system through well-defined interfaces, minimizing dependencies and potential impacts on other parts of the system when changes are made.
