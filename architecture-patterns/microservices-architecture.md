# Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture is a design pattern where a large application is broken down into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. This can help improve [Scalability](/glossary/scalability.md), flexibility, and agility.

When using microservices architecture, it's important to ensure that the various services are communicating effectively with each other.

Architecture diagrams can be particularly useful for mapping out the communication pathways between different microservices and ensuring that they are working together seamlessly. In these diagrams, each microservice can be represented as a separate Component with clearly defined inputs and outputs.
