# Client Server Architecture

Client-server architecture is a model for organizing computer systems, where applications are divided into two distinct parts: 

- The client, which is the part of the system that interacts directly with the user.
- The server, which is the part that provides services and resources to the client.

## The Client 
The client-side component is responsible for presenting the user interface, gathering user input, and sending requests to the server. It typically runs on the user's device, such as a web browser or a mobile app. The client communicates with the server through a network, typically the internet, using a standardized protocol such as HTTP or TCP/IP.

## The Server 
The server-side component is responsible for processing requests from the client, executing business logic, and managing data storage. It typically runs on a dedicated server or a cloud platform, and it may interact with other servers or services to fulfill the client's requests. The server communicates with the client through the same network and protocol used by the client.

This architecture offers several benefits, including scalability, reliability, and security. 
By separating the user interface and business logic into different components, developers can more easily update and maintain the system. Additionally, it allows for better resource management, as the server can handle heavy processing and data storage tasks, while the client can focus on providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
