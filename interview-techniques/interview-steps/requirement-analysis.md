# Requirement Analysis

### Functional Requirements 

During a system design interview, you'll likely be asked to design a system that meets specific functional requirements. To prepare for this, it's important to practice identifying the functional features that are most relevant to the target users. This involves understanding the user's needs and designing a system that meets those needs in a way that is efficient, effective, and user-friendly.

For example, if you're designing a social media platform like Twitter, you might focus on features like real-time updates, easy sharing and tagging, and the ability to follow and interact with other users. If you're designing a file-sharing or real-time collaboration app, you might focus on features like secure file storage and sharing, real-time editing and collaboration tools, and user access controls.

### Non-Functional Requirements 

In addition to identifying the functional features that are relevant to the target users, it's important to consider the system attributes required to deliver an outstanding user experience. This includes factors like scalability, reliability, and consistency.

For example, not every system needs to be consistent across all nodes. In the case of social media platforms like Twitter, it's fine to show feeds that are inconsistent across multiple users, as users are primarily interested in seeing updates from people they follow. However, the same level of inconsistency would be a complete showstopper for file-sharing and real-time collaboration apps, where users require consistent access to the same files and data.
