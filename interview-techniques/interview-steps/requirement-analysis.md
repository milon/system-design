# Requirement Analysis

### Functional Requirements 

In a system design interview, you will likely be required to create a system tailored to specific functional requirements. To prepare for this, it is crucial to practice identifying the functional elements most pertinent to the intended users. This entails comprehending the users' needs and crafting an efficient, effective, and user-friendly system that fulfills those requirements.

For instance, if you are tasked with designing a social media platform similar to Twitter, your emphasis may be on functionalities such as instant updates, effortless sharing and tagging, and the capacity to follow and engage with other users. Conversely, when designing a file-sharing or real-time collaboration application, your focus might shift towards features like secure file storage and sharing, real-time editing and collaboration tools, and user-access management.

### Non-Functional Requirements 

In addition to pinpointing the functional characteristics pertinent to the intended users, it becomes imperative to consider the system qualities essential for providing an exceptional user experience. These qualities encompass aspects such as scalability, reliability, and uniformity.

For instance, not every system necessitates uniformity across all its nodes. In the context of social media platforms like Twitter, it's acceptable to display feeds that vary among different users since users are primarily interested in viewing updates from those they follow. However, maintaining the same level of inconsistency would be a significant impediment for file-sharing and real-time collaboration applications, where users depend on consistent access to identical files and data.
