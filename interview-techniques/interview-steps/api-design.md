# API Design

After completing the data modeling step in system design interviews, the next step is to define API endpoints that expose the functionality required for the previously defined features. It's important to limit the initial design to function names, input parameters, and responses. However, it's also crucial to be prepared to discuss URL strings, HTTP methods, and response codes.

### Function Name 

The function name should accurately describe the functionality of the API endpoint. For example, if you're designing an API for a social media platform, you might have functions like "create_post" or "get_user_profile".

### Input Parameters

Input parameters are the data that the API endpoint requires to perform its function. It's important to define these parameters clearly and in a way that makes it easy for users to understand what data is required. For example, if you're designing an API for a ride-sharing app, you might have parameters like "start_location", "end_location", and "ride_type".

### Response

The response should provide the expected output of the API endpoint. This could be in the form of JSON or any other format that is appropriate for the system being designed.

### Technical URL design

In addition to defining the function name, input parameters, and response, it's important to be prepared to discuss URL strings, HTTP methods, and response codes. 

The URL string should accurately reflect the functionality of the API endpoint and make it easy for users to understand what the endpoint does. HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, should be chosen based on the functionality of the endpoint. Finally, response codes should be used to indicate the status of the API call and provide users with information about any errors or issues that occurred.

By designing API endpoints that accurately reflect the system's functionality, and being prepared to discuss URL strings, HTTP methods, and response codes, system designers can demonstrate their ability to design scalable and user-friendly systems.
